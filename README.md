# py-live-coding

Live Python Coding environment. Currently a clone of a js live coding environment I wrote a while back, but I am re-working it to work with python.

Ideas:

* Live Coding
* Reverse Debugging
  * Ability to query code execution using pandas or sql db
* Full execution trace output
* Visualizations of code execution and structure
* Visualizations of code hot spots (heatmap over code or trace, bar charts, etc)
